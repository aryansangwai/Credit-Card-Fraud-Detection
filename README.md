Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant issue that causes financial losses. This project uses machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to minimize false negatives (missed fraud cases) while keeping false positives (incorrect fraud cases) low.

Key steps include:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns.
Training classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluating models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized transaction data for privacy reasons. It includes:

Numerical features (e.g., transaction amounts, anonymized variables).
A target column: 0 for legitimate transactions and 1 for fraudulent transactions.
The dataset can be found on Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced data.
XGBoost for advanced classification.
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the data: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Train the models: Train machine learning models using the prepared data:


python evaluate_models.py
Visualize results: Use the notebooks/ folder for Jupyter Notebooks 
containing detailed visualizations and analysis.

Model Details
The following models are implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression: Simple linear model for binary classification.
Random Forest: Ensemble-based method for robust classification.
XGBoost: Gradient boosting method for high accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) (optional): For comparison.
Feature engineering steps include:

Standardization of features.
Handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	97.5%	92.3%	87.6%	89.9%	0.975
Random Forest	98.9%	96.4%	94.1%	95.2%	0.990
XGBoost	99.1%	97.2%	95.5%	96.3%	0.991
Note: Results may vary depending on random state and hyperparameter tuning.

Future Improvements
Experiment with additional algorithms such as deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for sequential data).
Implement real-time fraud detection for streaming data.
Enhance interpretability using SHAP or LIME for model explainability.
Integrate the model with a web application or API for practical usage.
